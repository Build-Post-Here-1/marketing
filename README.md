# marketing

# These are the marketing pages that I have designed for our subreddit finder product. 

# There is a landing page, an about page, and a login button which links you to the application itself.
# All the HTML is laid out in the two files as you would expect, and the CSS is organized by styles that apply universally and/ or landing page specific, about page specific, and finally different settings for different screen sizes.
